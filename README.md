# Design Thinking in Action: UX Problem Solving through Ideation, User Stories, Scenarios, and Architecture

This UX experiment documents the process of solving a user experience challenge using the Design Thinking methodology. It involves applying ideation techniques, writing user stories and scenarios, and designing an initial information architecture to support the solution.

---

## Objective

To simulate a real-world UX problem-solving process using the Design Thinking framework, culminating in the creation of structured user-centered artifacts like user stories, scenarios, and architecture diagrams.

## Aim

- To understand and apply each stage of the Design Thinking process
- To develop practical skills in ideation, empathy mapping, user story writing, and UX architecture
- To document the thinking and design process in a structured and iterative way

## Methodology: Design Thinking Process

1. **Empathize**  
   Understand user needs through observation and research.

2. **Define**  
   Frame a user-centered problem statement.

3. **Ideate**  
   Brainstorm and explore potential solutions without constraints.

4. **Prototype**  
   Create basic structures or wireframes (optional in this stage).

5. **Test**  
   Outline how the solution would be validated with users (can be theoretical for this experiment).

## Procedure and Steps

### Step 1: Choose a UX Problem  
Pick a real-world UX challenge (e.g., improving public transport apps, streamlining hospital appointment booking).

### Step 2: Empathy and Research  
- Identify users and their challenges  
- Use interviews, surveys, or secondary research  
- Create an **Empathy Map**

### Step 3: Define the Problem  
- Write a clear, concise problem statement  
- Example: “Busy professionals struggle to find and prepare healthy meals during weekdays.”

### Step 4: Ideation  
- Conduct a brainstorming session (mind map, SCAMPER, “How Might We”)  
- Choose 1–2 feasible solution directions

### Step 5: User Stories and Scenarios  
- Write user stories using the format:  
  `As a [user], I want to [goal] so that [benefit]`  
- Develop real-world scenarios showing how different users interact with the solution

### Step 6: Information Architecture  
- Sketch the high-level structure of your solution  
- Create a sitemap or screen flow  
- Optional: Include early wireframes or sketches

### Step 7: Document and Reflect  
- Reflect on design decisions  
- Summarize what worked, what didn’t, and possible next steps
